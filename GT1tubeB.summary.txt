The archive contains a joint alignment of the phiGT1/Mx8/Pr tubeB family with the LUZ24 family, the T7 family, and the P22 family. phiGT1 tube B is detected as similar to PF11134 (P22) by the HHpred HMM to HMM comparison, but not by hmmer.   The archive contains HMM models for this joint alignment.  It also contains the nexus file with a joint alignment used to create the timetree in the supported manuscript.
