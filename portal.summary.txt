This portal archive has an alignment and HMM models representing a fusion of multiple Pfam portal families including PF16510 (P22)   PF04860 (Mu), PF05136.14 (lambda), PF05133.15 (SPP1), PF07230.14 (T4); PF12236 (T7).  It is estimated to have a common ancestor at about 3.6 Gya.  However, it is not global in that there are some phage portal families that I have been unable to fuse into it without radically degrading the number of confidently aligned residues.  Its purpose in my studies is as an alignment tool for creating timetrees extending into the early times of life on Earth.  The portal protein has a helical bundle domain that tends to raise chance matches with other helical or coiled-coil proteins.  The nexus file used to make the figure in the paper is also included.
