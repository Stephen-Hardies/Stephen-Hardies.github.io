This archive has an alignment and HMM models for sequences matching to phiGT1gp11, a small frame appearing downstream of the major capsid protein gene and conserved as far away as the LUZ24-like phages, related by a ~1.5 Gya common ancestor.  There is no Pfam model for this family as of 3/19/23.  The protein is detected in the mature virion by mass spectrometry.  The the nexus file for creation of the tree in the supported manuscript is included.
