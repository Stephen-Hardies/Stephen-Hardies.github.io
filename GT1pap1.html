      Identification of structural and morphogenesis genes of
      Sulfitobacter phage phiGT1 and placement within the evolutionary
      history of the podoviruses.Stephen C. Hardies, Byung C. Cho, Gwang

    <p>The object of this manuscript is to make timetrees relating the
      phiGT1 core structural proteins to a series of common ancestors
      with other podoviral families over a time span leading back to the
      origin of podoviruses, estimated to be &gt; 3.2 Gya.&nbsp; This
      generally required making alignments of the relevant protein
      families covering a greater extent of divergence than is typically
      attempted.<br>
