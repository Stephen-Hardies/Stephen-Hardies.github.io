The archive has an alignment and HMM models built around the phiGT1 scaffold protein extending to a common ancestor about 1.5 Gya.  The group includes numbers of well known phages, e.g. Pseudomonas phage LUZ24 or Sinorhizobium phage phiM5, as well as members from prospective prophages and from metagenomic data.  Its members do not match to any familiy in Pfam as of 3/11/23.  A result is included showing an ancient relationship to the P22 scaffold by HMM to HMM comparison.
