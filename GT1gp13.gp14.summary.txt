PhiGT1 gp13 and phiGT1 gp14 are highly diverged paralogs of the gene known as tubular tail A in T7 and head completeion protein gene4 in P22. Both are detected in the mature virion by mass spectrometry.  There is no Pfam model for either of these as of 3/2023.  The archive contains alignments and HMM models for each of gp13 and gp14 back to common ancestors ~ 1.5 Gya.  It also contains the nexus file with a joint alignment used to create the timetree in the supported manuscript
